Extract information about lice and hosts from a PDF

There's not too much for anyone to see here. It's just a single Jupyter notebook parsing a single PDF and putting the data into tabular (CSV/Worksheet) form. Dr. Allen wanted me to explain the steps so, there is some exposition. I should also note that along with using BeautifulSoup4 I used regular expressions. The former was a good decision, and the later less so. Live and learn… maybe a simple bottom-up parser would have been cleaner.
