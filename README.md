Extract information about lice and hosts from a PDF

There's not too much for anyone to see here. I'm just parsing a single PDF and putting the data into tabular (CSV/Worksheet) form. My boss wanted me to explain the steps so there is some exposition. I should also note that along with using BeautifulSoup4 I used regular expressions. The former was a good decision, and the later less so. Live and learnâ€¦ maybe a simple bottom-up parser.
